From all your figures, tell me the greatest one for interpreting your data, and justify why
by explicitly comparing it to some other figures! Write which figure, why and your
comparison on your README.MD file.

To me, the figure 1 from a Seaborn lmplot with x="BMI", y="Y", hue="SEX"  is one of the greatest for interpreting the data. The 
regression line shows the direct relation between BMI and why and with hue= SEX we can see the little difference between the 
two sex. I one look, Seaborn lmplot give an idea of the range, the mean and the standard deviation of two variable. With the 
regression line It gives great inside on the relation between your most important variable like every time you increase your BMI by 
5 you increase Y by 50. The negative point of lmplot is that the variable input is limited. It's not great for a one look big picture of 
all the variable. For a more global view on all the data a Seaborn correlation heat map is doing a great job as we can see in the figure 2.
From that Seaborn correlation heat map we can see that BMI has the strongest correlation with Y closely with S5. We can also 
see that S3 look like a interesting variable with a strong negative correlation with S4 and a negative correlation with Y. A 
correlation heat map is a good way to start the visualization to get a big picture on the relation between our variable, but after that 
Seaborn lmplot is a much better tool to get into the detail of that relation and to me are way more easy to interpret than 3D plot 
that are sometimes confusing.
